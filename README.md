# Pixel-Art (*Work in Progress*)
A collection of my pixel art projects and animations

> [!NOTE]  
> These are not all my projects, I have yet to upload most of them.

Want to see some of the pixel art cards i made for a project? Check out this custom [card library](https://nocskir.com/card-dex.php). Note that some of the art is made in collaboration with @HenrikHaaland and @jahaa023.
